## 🌍 About Endangered Species

An endangered species is one that is at high risk of extinction in the near future, either globally or within a specific region. Species become endangered due to factors such as habitat destruction, poaching, climate change, and invasive species. Conservation efforts, including legal protections, habitat restoration, and captive breeding programs, aim to prevent extinction.

### Conservation Status Categories

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List is the most recognized system for assessing species' conservation status:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Extinct (EX) | No individuals remain |
| Extinct in the Wild (EW) | Only survive in captivity |
| Critically Endangered (CR) | Extremely high risk of extinction |
| Endangered (EN) | Very high risk of extinction |
| Vulnerable (VU) | High risk of extinction |
| Near Threatened (NT) | Close to becoming threatened |
| Least Concern (LC) | No immediate risk |

Over 195 countries have committed to protecting endangered species through biodiversity action plans and conservation programs.

## 📊 Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with three main tables to track endangered species and sightings:

### Species Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE species (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    common_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    scientific_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    conservation_status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    estimated_wild_population INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Individuals Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE individuals (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    nickname VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    species_id INTEGER REFERENCES species(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Sightings Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE sightings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    individual_id INTEGER REFERENCES individuals(id),
    sighting_datetime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    location TEXT NOT NULL,
    healthy BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    spotter_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    image_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Relationships
- Each `species` can have multiple `individuals`
- Each `individual` belongs to one `species`
- Each `individual` can have multiple `sightings`
- Each `sighting` is associated with one `individual`

### Key Features
- Timestamps for audit trails
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Required fields marked as `NOT NULL`
- Flexible location format using TEXT
- Email validation for spotter contact
- Optional image URLs for sighting documentation
